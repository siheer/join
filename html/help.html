                <h2>How to use it</h2>
                <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span class="join-span">Join</span>:</p>
                <ol class="heavy-points">
                    <li>
                        <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
                        <p>When you log in to <span class="join-span">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This
                            board represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress",
                            "Await feedback" and "Done".</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
                        <p>In <span class="join-span">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects.
                            Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information.
                            Once added, tasks can be assigned to these contacts.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
                        <p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual
                            tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the
                            task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
                        <p>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging
                            and dropping the card from one list to another or by clicking the button in the right upper
                            corner of the card (if shown).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
                        <p>Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a
                            card will permanently remove it from the board.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Remember that using <span class="join-span"></span>Join effectively requires consistent
                    updates from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the current state of your
                    project.</p>
